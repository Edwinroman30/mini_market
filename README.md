# Mini e-Market

This web application represent a simple CRUD application + user session management. The representation of the app
is about a electronic market or e-market, where I was focus on the technical requirements and also putting a 
bit of my styling skills.

### Technical requirements:

- They must use viewmodels and validations must be performed from them.
- Entity framework must be used with code first for data persistence.
- The project has to be visually understandable (Use bootstrap).
- The project must use the ONION architecture (This must be applied 100% correctly, in case of any error in it, it will be considered incorrect)
Generic repository and service must be used.


### Framework:
- `ASP .Net Core MVC 5`
